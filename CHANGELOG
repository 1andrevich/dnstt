## v0.20200430.0

Send leftover packets (those that were too big to fit in the current DNS
response) to the correct client in the future. Before, such leftover
packets were included in the next response to be sent, regardless of the
client it was intended for.

Fix the loop that packs packets into responses in the server. Before, if
there were not a packet immediately available, the response would always
be empty. Now, a packet has until the response timeout to be included.

Buffer the DoT transport in the client so that length prefixes and DNS
queries happen in the same send.

Don't look for encoded packets in a response that was too short to
contain a ClientID.
